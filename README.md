Chatter

In this age of pictures, hashtags, Reels and Tiktoks, likes and comments, a traditional bookworm’s heaven would be a blog to get access to more text-based content. Chatter aims to be that heaven specifically for this kind of audience. A multi-functional platform where authors and readers can create and have access to their own content.
